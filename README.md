# Particle Simulator
Hello!

This is my simulation of a pair of a positron and electron under the influence of an Electric field and Magnetic field.
The simulation is used with numerical integration with the leap frog method.

I also wrote a song to express my appreciation of how beautiful the relationship between this positron and electron.
